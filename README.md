# Code-Quiz
This is my homework submission for an assignment where I had to build a quiz with multiple-choice questions, have it run in the browser, feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code, feature a clean and polished user interface, and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
